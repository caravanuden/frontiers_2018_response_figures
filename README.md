# frontiers_2018_response_figures

Figures to supplement our responses to reviewers for "Modeling semantic encoding in a common neural representational space" (Van Uden & Nastase et al, 2018).

response_fig1 accompanies our response to: "Next to plotting the difference between model fits, it might be insightful to plot the correlations between the representational geometries obtained when using e.g. hyperalignment vs no alignment within the same subjects. This would show how representational geometries themselves change purely as a function of the alignment."

response_fig2 accompanies our response to: "Examinations of the smoothness using prediction maps seem indirect. Given that the authors estimated the rich vertex-wise encoding models, they should be able to examine the smoothness of representation more directly using vertex-wise weight vectors (i.e., Huth et al., 2012 Fig 8 or something equivalent)."
